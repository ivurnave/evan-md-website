# Hi! I'm Evan :)
I work as a Sr. Software Engineer at Target in Minneapolis. I have many hobbies, including painting, woodworking, pottery, making and playing video games, and more. This site serves as a living resume for me and my work over the years. When I remember to, I update this site with my latest projects.
